# odin-landing-page
This is my first Odin project, I'm supposed to make a landing page that follows a certain layout. What the lading page ends up looking like though is up to me. I'm not sure what this will end up looking like in the end but I'm eager to get to work on it. 

By the end of this project, I am hoping to have demonstrated skills in;
1. Flexbox
2. CSS Cascade, Selectors, Classes
3. Proper HTML Semantics and Syntax
4. Hopefully a little JavaScript when I learn some more. 

Stay tuned

Update 12/12/23
Well there we have it, it only took me a few days between work, but I have completed my first Odin project! I'm pretty proud of myself because it was alot easier than when I first attempted the Odin project a year ago, I only made it a fraction of the way in before having to put everything on hold. Grateful that I can now dedicate the time needed to learn. 

I plan to come back to this project to clean up the class names and clean up the style.css file (combine selectors, maybe seperate the stylings into their own seperate folder based on what the styling controls etc). Who knows maybe I will turn this template into more than just a template.

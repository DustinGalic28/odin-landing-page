# odin-landing-page
This is my first Odin project, I'm supposed to make a landing page that follows a certain layout. What the lading page ends up looking like though is up to me. I'm not sure what this will end up looking like in the end but I'm eager to get to work on it. 

By the end of this project, I am hoping to have demonstrated skills in;
1. Flexbox
2. CSS Cascade, Selectors, Classes
3. Proper HTML Semantics and Syntax
4. Hopefully a little JavaScript when I learn some more. 

Stay tuned
